<h3>Living in US</h3>
<p>
In the summer of my 4th grade, my family moved to the US(it was a last-minute decision). My father 
returned to India soon after to manage his business while the rest of my family lived with my aunt at her house. That summer
was one of the best ones as my cousins(all three) had summer vacation and as I would join school which would start in September, we would
have three whole months for fun. My cousin-who is three years older than me- and I would go to the public library every day
as they would set up various activities. There was this one contest where we would have to read a book and write its summary. On
submitting the summary we would get various prizes such as free meals in various different resteraunts, goodies,etc. Since this
contest was only for children below 13, my brothers,my cousin and I would save some coupons for my older cousins and we would 
go to the resteraunts. I became especially close to my cousins as I was just used to seeing them once a year and since we now had
more time to spend together we would do various activites such as making necklaces out of beads, giving each other makeovers,
imitating the people we knew and watching TV and movies together. Within a month, my family started renting an apartment
which was just two miles away from my cousins' house. I started to go to Swanson Elementary School along with my brothers and
younger cousin. School was fun as there would be several events throughout the year. There was this one event where all students
of non-American descent had to bring food which is a part of their culture- so that day we had a chance to try out different
cuisines such as Greek,Spanish,Indian,Italian,etc.

<h3>Middle School</h3>
<p>
The next year we had to go to Wisconsin Hills Middle School and this was the phase where we became 
a bit more responsible as we were handed out assignments and tests were conducted. This school too was a lot of fun as we would
have several programmes each month. There was this one event for charity which would occur around the time of Thanksgiving. We were
given three days to donate canned food and if the entire school (grades 6,7 and 8) managed to donate more than a 1000 items, the
principal would dress up as a turkey. There was another event where each child who had donated 10 items or more was allowed to throw
a pie at any of the teachers who had agreed to participate in this. This event occured during lunch and a row of teachers would sit
on chairs and the entire grade would cheer those who were throwing pies at the teachers. We did not have much pressure of studies
and I had a lot of fun as several of my friends lived in my neighbourhood-before most of them moved away while I was in 7th.

<h3>Returning to India</h3>

<p>
In the summer of 7th grade, my family decided to return to India. This was as it was becoming increasingly
hard for my dad to manage his business back here as well as to be with us. When we returned, we lived in a hotel for a few days
as the finishing touches were being added to my new house. My parents encouraged me to join Vidyaranya as they liked the fact that
it did not put too much pressure on students. Initially, I was against this but later relented. My first day of Vidyaranya was 
memorable in a way. I was put in one of the two sections and the teacher had noticed me but did not ask me my name until the 
end of the class. I talked to a few of the students but during English class, the teacher decided that I should be put in the 
other section so as to balance out the number of students. She took me to the other section and that's where I met most of my
friends. School was fun in Vidyaranya. We also had excursions to places like Kaigal, Bijapur, Hampi, etc. Excursions were especially
fun as we would shop together and tour the places. We would go sightseeing in urban areas and help out with farming and other
activities in rural areas.

<h3> Junior and Senior Years</h3>
<p>
For 11th and 12th grade, I went to Meridian School. I did not like the school as much as I felt that 
they would waste a lot of time and then call us for classes on Saturday. There were several days where we would only have a class
or two a day as there was one event or another which was approaching. As studies were taken more seriously now, the only time my friends
and I could actually enjoy was during lunch. However, since we had free periods before annual days, sports days,etc we would utilise that 
time to study together or chat. 
</p>
<h3>Summer</h3>
<p>
Right after board exams, I started preparing for JEE and the other competitive exams. As I was not serious
about them and since my Chemistry teachers were switched at the last moment, I did not fare well in most of the exams. However, during
June, I got a lot of free time to do the things I like-especially reading. Since we had exams frequently, I would not get enough time to
read at all during the school days. I could only manage to read a book or two in the holidays. One of my friends who had not
written any competitive exams spent most of her vacation reading novels and she recommended some of them to me. I also had time to catch up
with old friends and shop a bit. In July, I had to decide which college I would be going to. I had already received admission
in Jawaharlal Nehru Trust University(JNTU) as well as Osmania College but I had my hopes pinned on IIIT-H. My father preferred
me to write the exams again next year if I would not receive admission here. However, I got admitted to this college in the 
ECE stream. Since the campus is only 45 minutes away from my house (in traffic), I usually go back home for the weekend and the
holidays.
