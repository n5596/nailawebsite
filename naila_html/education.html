<h2>Elementary and Middle School</h2>
<p>	
I had studied at Nasr School for Girls (Khairtabad) till I was in the 4th grade. After completing the school
year, my family and I visited our relatives in Wisconsin, USA for the usual summer vacation. However, by the end of our
vacation my mother had decided that she wanted to live close to her parents for a few years as it would become increasingly
difficult for them to visit India because of their old age and that in any state of emergency it would nearly impossible
for either of them to meet. Because of this last minute decision, we ended up staying in America for three years where
I would complete my 5th (at Swanson Elementary) ,6th and 7th grades (at Wisconsin Hills Middle School).

<h2>High School</h2>
<p>
In July 2010, we decided to return back to India and my parents decided to put me in Vidyaranya High School
along with my brothers. Initially, I was hesitant as I preferred to return back to Nasr as I was more familiar with it. My 
parents, however, insisted I try this school which was extremely different from Nasr. First of all, there were no uniforms 
in VHS and as there were very few students in each grade (about 40), we were well familiarized with our seniors and juniors.
Also, there was no pressure of attaining good marks-we were just required to understand the concepts to the best of our abilities
and not cheat. I studied 8th,9th and 10th grades at Vidyaranya (Vidyaranya only goes up till 10th grade) and later shifted
to Meridian School at Banjara Hills. I took up MPC along with Informatics Practice. I took up last-minute JEE coaching which
I did not take seriously, hence I underperformed in most of the entrances I wrote this summer.

<h2> New Beginning:College</h2>
<p>
However, because of my decent SAT score, I got admission in IIIT-H in the ECE branch. My options were to
either take this up or repeat next year again. I decided to take the oppurtunity and here I am!
