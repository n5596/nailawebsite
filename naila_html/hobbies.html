My hobbies include reading, swimming, playing badminton and watching TV. 
<br>
<h2>Reading</h2>
<p>
My favourite genre in books is realistic fiction. My favourite books include the Fall Away series by Penelope Douglas,
Gemini series by Penelope Ward as well as the Airhead series by Meg Cabot.
</p>
<h4>Fall Away</h4>
<p>
This entire series revolves around a group of friends who face different kinds of problems and pressures in life. It revolves around Jared,Tate,KC,Jax,Madoc and Fallon. Jared's mother is an alcoholic and he also deals with the trauma of his father abusing him when he was young. This leads him to a life revolving around races and parties-the only place where he can forget about his problems. Tate's mother had passed away a long time ago and as her father lives in Italy for work purposes, she usually feels lonely and is unable to bear the bullying at school. KC has an identity crisis as her real name is Juliet but she goes by her dead sister's name as her father blames himself for his daughter's untimely demise and is unable to accept the fact that she is no more. He therefore pretends that she is alive and therefore refers to Juliet as KC. Jax- Jared's half-brother, has been abandoned by his mother and his father had physically abused him also. Madoc belongs to a rich family where his father believes that his absence in his son's life can be compensated by giving him money. Fallon- Madoc's stepsister- deals with a mother who only cares about money,power,parties,etc while her father is usually absent as he is a criminal.
</p>
<h4>Chicken Soup</h4>
<p>
The Chicken Soup series is another one of my favourites.
It consists of short stories given by people from all over the world and sometimes even celebrities submit their stories revolving 
around certain life events. The entire book is divided into several topics such as losing someone, facing bullying,etc and stories 
revolving around such topics are grouped together. A few illustrations as well as quotes revolving around the topic are also given.
Since these stories are submitted by ordinary people like us, it is easy to relate to them which is why I enjoy reading them. 
</p>
<h4>Wattpad and Comics</h4>

<p>
I also like to read random stories on Wattpad such as The Arrogant Professor, Unlikely and Faking It. I usually read the books
of humor and mystery genres on Wattpad. However, the one thing I dislike about Wattpad is that most books of the same genre 
follow a similar plotline and it gets kind of predictable. Also, most writers update their stories after long periods of time
or at times lose interest and abruptly end their stories. I usually read all the books which my friends recommend as we have similar
likes and dislikes and I was introduced to nearly all of my favourites by them. 
I also like to read comics such as Calvin and
Hobbes, which is my favourite one, as well as Archie Comics. I sometimes also like to read Wikipedia articles on famous people,
unsolved mysteries,etc.
</p>
<h2>Swimming</h2>
<p>
Swimming has been one of my favourite sports since I was young. Every summer, I go to Nizam Club in the mornings for
this activity and then visit the club library. I find swimming extremely relaxing and since it is not too physically exerting
I enjoy it. I have been going to Nizam Club to swim since I was young but I have not visited the pool for the last two years
as during the summer of 11th grade, I had gone to USA to visit my relatives and the summer of 12th grade was spent preparing
for the competitive exams. 
</p>
<h2>TV and Internet</h2>
<p>

I also enjoy watching TV and mindlessly surfing the Internet. I usually don't watch any particular TV show but prefer
to watch movies or songs. My favourite types of movies are romantic comedies. I mostly watch Bollywood movies but at times also watch a couple of Hollywood ones. My favourite movies include Housefull, I Hate Luv Storys, The DUFF,Partner,Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs, Spy,etc. My favourite actors in Bollywood are Katrina Kaif, Alia Bhatt and Imran Khan. At times I like to watch Impractical Jokers or MasterChef.
</p>
<p>
Most of my time is spent on the Internet. I like to surf on certain websites such as BuzzFeed, HollywoodLife, Pinkvilla,etc.
I also spend a lot of time surfing through various quotes on life and happiness. My favourite ones are those by Rabindranath Tagore, Winston Churchill and Oscar Wilde. I also like to watch videos by Fouseytube,ZaidAliT,TVF,etc on Youtube. At times, I also end up on Wikipedia reading biographies of
random people whom I have heard about.
