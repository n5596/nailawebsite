I am Naila Fatima, a UG1 student at IIIT-Hyderabad. I am currently pursuing B. Tech in ECE (Electronics and Communications Engineering) and have gotten admission through the DASA (Direct Admission for Students Abroad) category.I am from Hyderabad, Telengana but had lived in Wisconsin, USA for a period of three years- because of which I have a foreign passport. I have completed my 11th and 12th from Meridian High School in Banjara Hills.

I like to read books-especially those which have never heard before facts. I also like to read Wikipedia pages on certain famous people.
I also like to swim and surf the Internet in my free time. I also like to go out with my friends- we usually end up frequenting GVK. I also enjoy going
out to eat with my friends and families. My favourite places have to be Ohri's (at Basheerbagh), Nizam Club , KFC and 4 Seasons.
